====================

An Esprima-based version of loop-protect.

Bounty
------

I'm offering a $10 bounty for unique failing test cases. All you have to do is prevent `npm test` from running to completion via a non-recursive infinite loop. Uniquenes will be determined at my discretion and if I think it's borderline I might instead choose to donate the promised bounty to a nonprofit of my choice. Bugs in dependencies will be considered, but no promises as to bounty eligibility. Simply open a PR with your failing test case!
